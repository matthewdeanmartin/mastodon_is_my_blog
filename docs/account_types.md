# Account Types

Each account type needs some UI affordance to deal with them.

## People
- People, they post storms/shorts and/or they participate in discussions
  - People you know IRL. They'll interact with your content even if it isn't good and a message from them is like a phone call, rude to ignore.
  - Self promoters, etc. Like companies except there is a person there who engages the community. Not bad per se.
  - Extremely online. If you read your feed, you see their content.
  - Occasional users. Unless you read their profile and filter out reposts, they are invisible to the regular algorithm
  - Special interest users. Subcategory that sticks to one topic.
  - Whole-life bloggers. Subcategory that won't stick to any topic
  - "I thought this was facebook". Subcategory that posts mostly about family and their pet. 


## Everything Else
- Readers. They post no content, no replies, but like, retweet content.
- Broadcasters, they post content, but don't discuss anything. They maybe cross posted from elsewhere.
    - Companies
    - Advertisers
- Content feeds. 100% links to elsewhere. May look like a crossposted RSS feed.
  - People that post a link to every newspaper article they like
  - RSS feeds
  - Newspapers and media outlets, like NPR
- Companies
  - Customer support
  - Purely ads, PR, corporate communications and so on

## Machines
- Conventional Bots. Some code that posts something silly every day, like emoji art
- LLM Bots. Some interface to LLM
