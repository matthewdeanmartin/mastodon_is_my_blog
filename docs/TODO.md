# TODO

## Post View
- Storms should be a nice tidy block.
- Counts don't update when changing users
- Discussions only show the disconnected middle part, should show entire tree.
- If bio is long, it should split across 2 columns

## Blogroll
- Seems to always sort the same way. Should continually update sort order based on who posted last

## Quality of life things
- Click on blog roll should pop user to top of screen
- When backend server is down, there should be some message and it should poll ( a cheap endpoint) for when it is up again
-
